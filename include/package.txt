@mainpage DSI reference implementation

This document describes the interface of the DSI reference implementation. The reference implementation is based on C++ STL so this is the only language binding currently available. 

Since DSI is heavily based on model driven development and therefore code generation, the base library interface is fairly small and contains only a couple of classes and functions visible to the public. The main items are:

   @li @link DSI::CCommEngine @c CCommEngine @endlink - the DSI communication engine containing the main event loop
   @li @link DSI::CServer @c CServer @endlink - the base class used by the code generator for DSI servers (aka stubs)
   @li @link DSI::CClient @c CClient @endlink - the base class for DSI clients (aka proxies)
   @li The servicebroker @link clientlib.h interface functions @endlink

The @c private/ subfolder contains code necessary for inline implementation purpose only and is not intended for public use. Therefore, it is not part of this documentation and interfaces may change without notice.
